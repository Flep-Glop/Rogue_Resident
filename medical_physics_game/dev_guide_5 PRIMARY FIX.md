# Medical Physics Game Reorganization: Summary

## Our Objective
Align the Medical Physics Game codebase with the original reorganization plan while resolving the confusion caused by:
1. A nested `medical_physics_game` folder structure
2. Files existing in multiple parallel locations

## Current Status
After running verification scripts, we found:

1. ✅ **Directory Structure**: All key directories now exist properly at the root level

2. ⚠️ **Migration Issues**:
   - 7 files from `./static/js/engine` (mostly skill tree and effects files) haven't been copied to the correct location
   - 45 files from the nested structure (`./medical_physics_game/frontend/static/js`) haven't been properly migrated

3. ⚠️ **Import Path Issues**:
   - Some Python files still reference old import paths (e.g., `import game_state`)
   - Some JavaScript files have outdated relative import paths

## Next Steps

1. **Complete File Migration**:
   - Move the missing engine files to proper locations (skill tree files → `./frontend/src/systems/skill_tree/`)
   - Examine the 45 files in the nested structure and move them to appropriate directories

2. **Fix Import Paths**:
   - Update Python imports to use the new structure (e.g., `from backend.core.state_manager import...`)
   - Update JavaScript import paths to reference the correct locations

3. **Update Configuration**:
   - Change app.py to use `static_folder='frontend/static'` and `template_folder='frontend/templates'`

4. **Test the Application**:
   - Run the application to ensure it works with the new structure
   - Test key functionality (map generation, character selection, etc.)

5. **Clean Up**:
   - Only after everything is working properly, remove the nested `./medical_physics_game` directory
   - Later, when fully confident, remove original `./static` and `./templates` directories

Would you like me to help with specific migration commands for the missing files or updating import paths in the next chat?
