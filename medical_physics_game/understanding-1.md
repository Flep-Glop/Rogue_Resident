# Understanding Game Architecture: A Restaurant Metaphor

I'd be happy to help you understand your game's architecture using a metaphor! Think of your game as a restaurant:

## The Restaurant Metaphor

### Core Components

1. **The Restaurant Building** (Project Structure)
   - **Kitchen** (Backend) - Where the food is prepared, but customers don't see
   - **Dining Room** (Frontend) - What customers directly experience
   - **Food Storage** (Data) - Ingredients and recipes stored for use

2. **The Kitchen Staff** (Backend Logic)
   - **Head Chef** (State Manager) - Orchestrates everything, keeps track of what's happening
   - **Sous Chefs** (Core Logic) - Implement specific cooking techniques (combat, progression)
   - **Recipe Book** (Game Rules) - Defines how ingredients should be combined

3. **Inventory System** (Data Layer)
   - **Pantry** (Repositories) - Organized storage where ingredients are retrieved from
   - **Ingredient Specifications** (Data Models) - Clearly defined properties of each ingredient
   - **Inventory Sheets** (Schemas) - Forms that ensure ingredients meet requirements

4. **The Dining Experience** (Frontend)
   - **Waitstaff** (UI Components) - Present information to the customer
   - **Table Settings** (Screens) - Different arrangements for different experiences
   - **Menu** (User Interface) - How customers interact with what's available

5. **Communication System** (Event System)
   - **Kitchen Bell** (Events) - Signals when something is ready or needed
   - **Order Tickets** (Event Handlers) - Instructions passed between kitchen and dining room

## How It All Works Together

1. A customer (player) places an order (makes an action)
2. The waitstaff (UI) writes it on a ticket and rings the bell (triggers an event)
3. The head chef (state manager) receives the order and assigns tasks
4. Sous chefs (core logic) retrieve ingredients from the pantry (repositories)
5. They prepare the dish according to recipes (game rules)
6. The completed dish is placed on the counter and the bell rings (event triggered)
7. Waitstaff (UI) delivers the result back to the customer (player)

## Why This Structure Matters

- **Separation of Concerns**: The customer doesn't need to see the kitchen mess
- **Modularity**: You can change the menu without rebuilding the kitchen
- **Scalability**: Adding more dishes or ingredients doesn't break existing ones
- **Maintainability**: If something breaks, you know exactly which station to check

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this metaphor in more detail, or how it maps to specific files in your reorganized project?
