# Medical Physics Game: Updated Developer Guide

## Current Reorganization Status

After our initial implementation of the reorganization plan, we've discovered some important differences between the theoretical structure described in the reorganization guide and the actual project structure. Here's an updated assessment:

## Structure Assessment

### What Was Expected vs. What We Found

| Aspect | Original Plan | Actual Structure | Status |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| Base Directory | Files inside medical_physics_game/ | Files at root level (./static, ./templates) | ⚠️ Deviation |
| Static Files | Specific CSS/JS hierarchy | Different file organization | ⚠️ Deviation |
| Templates | Specific template structure | Different organization and fewer templates | ⚠️ Deviation |
| Application Structure | Modular, separated concerns | Less structured, more integrated | ⚠️ Deviation |

### Current Implementation

We've created the target structure in `medical_physics_game/frontend/` and copied essential files:

```
medical_physics_game/frontend/
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   │   ├── base/
│   │   │   ├── layout.css
│   │   │   ├── reset.css
│   │   │   └── variables.css
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── screens/
│   │   │   ├── game.css
│   │   │   └── skill_tree.css
│   │   └── themes/
│   │       └── retro_theme.css
│   └── js/
│       ├── components/
│       ├── core/
│       │   ├── bootstrap.js
│       │   └── game.js
│       ├── engine/
│       │   └── core/
│       ├── ui/
│       └── utils/
└── templates/
    ├── base.html
    ├── errors/
    │   ├── 404.html
    │   └── 500.html
    └── pages/
        ├── character_select.html
        ├── index.html
        └── item_editor.html
```

## Key Observations

1. **Structure Deviation**: The actual project structure differs significantly from what the reorganization guide assumed.

2. **Multiple Parallel Implementations**: We found evidence of:
   - Original files at root level (`./static`, `./templates`)
   - Partial new structure in `./frontend`
   - Target structure in `./medical_physics_game/frontend`

3. **File Naming Differences**: Some file names didn't match exactly (e.g., `retro-theme.css` vs `retro_theme.css`).

## Steps Completed

1. ✅ Created basic target directory structure
2. ✅ Copied essential CSS files to new structure
3. ✅ Copied core JavaScript files
4. ✅ Created/copied base templates and error pages
5. ✅ Updated app.py configuration for proper static and template paths

## Next Steps

1. **Import Path Fixing**: JavaScript files will need their import paths updated to match the new structure.
   ```javascript
   // Old: 
   import { EventSystem } from '../engine/core/event_system.js'
   // New:
   import { EventSystem } from '../../core/event_system.js'
   ```

2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component after migration to identify integration issues.

3. **Route Verification**: Ensure all Flask routes correctly render templates from the new location.

4. **CSS Reference Updates**: Check that all CSS class references remain consistent between HTML and CSS files.

5. **Progressive Old File Removal**: Only after thorough testing, mark old files as deprecated and eventually remove them.

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **JavaScript Module Loading**: The restructuring may break relative import paths in JS modules.

2. **Static Asset References**: Images, fonts, and other resources may have broken references.

3. **Flask Route Configuration**: Routes may need updates to point to new template locations.

4. **Template Extension**: Templates extending base.html might need path adjustments.

5. **Data File Access**: Ensure data files (JSON, etc.) are properly accessible from the new structure.

## Recommended Testing Procedure

Before removing any old files, thoroughly test:

1. Basic page loading
2. Character selection functionality
3. Game initialization
4. Map generation and rendering
5. Node interaction
6. Skill tree functionality
7. Item management

Only after verifying each component works should you proceed with removing deprecated files.

## Concluding Thoughts

The reorganization is proceeding, but with notable deviations from the original plan. These deviations aren't necessarily problematic but require careful attention to ensure all components continue to work together. The current approach of building the new structure alongside the old before transitioning is prudent and reduces the risk of extended downtime.
