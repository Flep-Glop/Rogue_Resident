## GAME CONCEPT

*Medical Physics Residency: The Roguelike Challenge* is an educational roguelike game that combines authentic medical physics knowledge with engaging gameplay. Players navigate the challenges of a medical physics residency through procedurally generated encounters, building knowledge and skills while experiencing the unique blend of scientific rigor and healthcare realities.

The game balances educational content with roguelike mechanics, creating a system where players learn through repeated attempts, gradual mastery, and varied approaches to problem-solving.

## GAME STRUCTURE

### Macro Structure: Residency Program

- **Complete Run** = One "Residency Year"
- Each successful run culminates in a "board exam" (boss encounter)
- Failing a run represents washing out of that year's program
- Meta-progression carries between runs via reputation and specialization

### Rotation System

The game is segmented into **themed rotation clusters**:

- Each rotation consists of 2-3 floors focused on a specific area of medical physics
- Rotations have their own visual themes, item pools, and challenge types
- Example rotations:
  - Radiation Safety
  - Imaging Physics
  - Treatment Planning
  - Nuclear Medicine
  - Quality Assurance
  - Radiobiology

### Floor Organization

- **Semi-randomized progression** creates variety while maintaining learning flow
- First rotation always introduces fundamentals (onboarding for new players)
- Middle rotations draw from a larger pool with controlled randomization
- Final rotation leads to the comprehensive challenge (boss encounter)
- Different "residency programs" offer different rotation sequences as difficulty modes

### Node Types

The game map contains various encounter types:
- **Question Nodes**: Physics knowledge challenges
- **Patient Case Nodes**: Clinical application scenarios
- **Event Nodes**: Narrative encounters with choices
- **Shop Nodes**: Opportunity to acquire items and upgrades
- **Rest Nodes**: Recover resources and make development choices
- **Elite Nodes**: Challenging encounters with greater rewards
- **Treasure Nodes**: Discover items and relics
- **Boss Nodes**: Major challenges testing comprehensive knowledge

## PROGRESSION SYSTEMS

### In-Run Progression

The core roguelike experience centers on progress within a single run:

- Beginning each run with baseline character capabilities
- Acquiring temporary items, relics, and knowledge during the run
- Building synergies between abilities and equipment
- Most progress is lost upon run completion (win or loss)

### Meta-Progression: Specialization & Reputation

A controlled amount of permanent progress occurs between runs:

- **Reputation** accumulates slowly across runs
- Reputation can be spent to permanently enhance character baselines
- Specialization paths unlock as reputation thresholds are reached
- Characters evolve from generic "residents" to specialized experts
- Meta-progression enhances variety without undermining the roguelike challenge

## ECONOMY & CURRENCIES

### Dual Currency System

The game employs two primary in-run currencies that create tension between theoretical and practical approaches:

1. **Insight**:
   - Represents theoretical knowledge and understanding
   - Earned through answering questions, solving problems, studying
   - Used for unlocking advanced concepts, skills, and certain items
   - Functions as both a score metric and a spendable resource

2. **Funding/Grants**:
   - Represents material resources and practical support
   - Earned through successful patient outcomes, practical applications
   - Used to purchase equipment, supplies, textbooks, and practical tools
   - Creates resource management decisions

### Meta-Currency: Reputation

- Earned in small amounts through notable achievements in runs
- Different specialties have their own reputation tracks
- Used to permanently unlock character capabilities between runs
- Spent on specialization options that define character development

## CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

### Starting Characters

- Begin with a basic roster of "Medical Physics Residents"
- Initial differences are subtle, providing varied starting approaches
- All characters share a common foundation of physics knowledge

### Specialization System

Characters evolve through specialization choices as they gain reputation:

- **Theory Specialist**: Emphasizes deep understanding of physics principles
  - Better insight gains, special access to advanced concepts
  - Unique relics: "Advanced Textbooks", "Quantum Understanding"
  
- **Clinical Expert**: Focuses on patient care and practical applications
  - Better patient outcomes, special dialogue options
  - Unique relics: "Bedside Manner", "Clinical Intuition"
  
- **Technical Savant**: Masters equipment and technical procedures
  - Equipment bonuses, calibration advantages
  - Unique relics: "Calibration Tools", "Engineer's Handbook"
  
- **Research Focus**: Prioritizes investigation and publication
  - Publication bonuses, experimental equipment access
  - Unique relics: "Research Grant", "Peer Review Network"

### Skill Trees

As characters gain reputation, they unlock specialized skill trees:
- Each specialization has its own branching development path
- Skills provide passive bonuses or active abilities
- Later branches offer powerful, specialized effects
- Players can mix specializations for hybrid builds

## ITEMS & RELICS SYSTEM

### Items (Consumables)

- **One-time use** tools, resources, and aids
- Provide temporary advantages for specific situations
- Examples:
  - "Existential Relief Potion" - Restores 1 life
  - "Groundhog Day Wristwatch" - Retry a failed question without penalty

### Relics (Permanents)

- **Persistent effects** that last for the entire run
- Define character builds and create synergies
- Examples:
  - "Nihilist's Clipboard" - Passively increases insight gain
  - "Schr√∂dinger's Spectacles" - 50% chance to auto-solve quantum questions

### Synergy System

Items and relics create meaningful combinations:
- Complementary effects that enhance each other
- Encourage diverse strategic approaches
- Support different specialization paths
- Create memorable, unique runs

## EDUCATIONAL APPROACH

### Knowledge Implementation

Rather than relying on memorizable content, the game focuses on:

1. **Parameterized Knowledge Testing**:
   - Questions with variable parameters that test understanding of relationships
   - Example: "A [X] MeV electron beam has range [Y] cm in water. Calculate Z."

2. **Context-Dependent Solutions**:
   - Correct approaches vary based on randomly generated conditions
   - Patient characteristics modify optimal treatment approaches
   - Equipment limitations force alternative solutions

3. **Application Over Recall**:
   - Emphasis on applying knowledge rather than reciting facts
   - Interactive scenarios that require interpreting data and making decisions
   - Problem-solving with multiple valid approaches

### Difficulty Scaling

- **Adaptive difficulty** adjusts to player performance
- Early rotations focus on fundamentals
- Later rotations introduce more complex concepts
- Board exam (boss) challenges comprehensive understanding
- Optional fellowship mode for mastery-level challenges

## VISUAL & NARRATIVE DIRECTION

### Visual Style

- **Retro-inspired pixel art** with modern flourishes
- Clean, readable UI for educational content
- Distinctive visual themes for each rotation area
- Character portraits with personality and progression visual cues

### Narrative Tone

- Balance of **medical seriousness** with **academic absurdity**
- Acknowledges the existential aspects of medical physics
- Humor that resonates with those familiar with academic/medical culture
- Characters that capture the diversity of approaches to the field

### Writing Approach

- Clear, accurate physics content presented accessibly
- Dialogue that reflects the unique culture of medical physics
- Events that capture both the technical and human elements of healthcare
- Touches of philosophical reflection on the nature of medicine, physics, and education
