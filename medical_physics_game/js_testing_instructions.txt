JavaScript Module Testing Instructions
=====================================

1. Open a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

2. Navigate to:
   file:///workspaces/Rogue_Resident/medical_physics_game/tests/js/core_test.html

3. Open the browser's developer console:
   - Chrome/Edge: Press F12 or right-click and select "Inspect" → "Console" tab
   - Firefox: Press F12 or right-click and select "Inspect Element" → "Console" tab

4. Look for any errors in the console output:
   - If you see green checkmarks (✅), the modules loaded successfully
   - If you see red X marks (❌), there are issues that need to be fixed

5. Common issues and fixes:
   - "Module not found": Check the file path in the import statement
   - "Unexpected token 'export'": Make sure the module uses proper ES6 export syntax
   - "Class not exported correctly": Ensure the class is properly exported
